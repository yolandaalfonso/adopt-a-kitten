/*
  The "App.css" file is dedicated to styling the MAIN APP COMPONENT'S LAYOUT AND DIRECT CHILDREN,
  focusing on rules that define the "overall page structure", such as main content areas, headers,
  or footers (if they are direct children of App) that aren't meant to be universally applied
  to every single element on the page but rather to the primary structural elements of the application's top level.
