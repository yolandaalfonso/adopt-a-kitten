/* 
  The "index.css" file serves as the GLOBAL STYLESHEET ENTRY POINT for our 'Adopt a Kitten' application. 
  It will contain foundational CSS rules such as "normalize.css" or "reset.css" imports,
  base typography (e.g., font-family, line-height on the body), root-level variables (e.g.,
  CSS custom properties for colors, spacing), and generic layout styles that define the overall structure
  and appearance of the application, ensuring a consistent visual baseline across all pages and components.
