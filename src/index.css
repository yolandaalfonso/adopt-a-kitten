/* 
  The "index.css" file serves as the GLOBAL STYLESHEET ENTRY POINT for our 'Adopt a Kitten' application. 
  It will contain foundational CSS rules such as "normalize.css" or "reset.css" imports,
  base typography (e.g., font-family, line-height on the body), root-level variables (e.g.,
  CSS custom properties for colors, spacing), and generic layout styles that define the overall structure
  and appearance of the application, ensuring a consistent visual baseline across all pages and components.

/* Applies correctly "normalize.css" as the very first layer of styling*/
@import 'normalize.css';

/* This is our custom "reset.css" (Its handle the global reset)*/
* {
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in the element's total width and height */
